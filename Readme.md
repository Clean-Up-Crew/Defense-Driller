# KILLER INSTINCT DEFENSE DRILLER BY CLEAN-UP CREW

## Overview
This is a program designed to train defensive reactions to certain overhead-low mixups.
The project is in its infancy right now, but it's working as intended for right now.
If you have any suggestions for it, please contact me on the KI Discord. I'd be happy to hear them!

## Installation
### Prerequisites
1. You need Python 3.8 or newer. This can be installed here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install pip on your computer as well.
3. Then, type this into your command prompt `pip install vgamepad`
4. Download the code of the repository and save it anywhere you like. Remember the file path.
5. Extract the folder if you downloaded it as a .zip file.

### How to Run
1. Open your terminal on your computer. Powershell works or just the cmd prompt.
2. Change the directory to where you saved the defense-driller.py file. This can be accomplished with `cd Your-Directory`
   (Replace `Your-Directory` with the location you put the file)
3. Type `python3 defense-driller.py` into the command prompt and hit enter.
4. It will prompt you for which character(s) you want to train against.
5. Go into training mode with yourself as player 1.
6. Select your character and the character you are training against.
7. Set the dummy to "Human".
8. Enjoy practicing your defense!

## Current Issues/ Todo List
1. Turn into a python executable so you don't need to install anything
2. Omen IAD j.hp, j.lk (cross up defense)
3. Tusk/Wulf/Eyedol alternating st.lk/throw (strike throw defense)
4. Thunder Horn Breaker xx Triplax/Command Grab/Ankle Slicer (OS defense)
